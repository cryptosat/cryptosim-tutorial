    <p>
      Welcome to the Cryptosim tutorial. This tutorial will teach you how to
      use cryptosim - the cryptosat simulator. The cryptosat simulator is
      designed to emulate the workings of a live satellite and demonstrate the
      functionality of the Cryptosat API.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the center of the screen there is a map visualizing the location of the
      cryptosat and the ground stations that we use to communicate with it.
      Ground stations appear as blue dots whereas the cryptosat will
      appear as a pulsing red or green circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the left panel is a javascript console that you can use to type in
      commands. Throughout this tutorial you will find code snippets that
      showcase commands for interacting with the Cryptosat API. You are welcome
      to type the commands into the console and see the outcome for yourself.
