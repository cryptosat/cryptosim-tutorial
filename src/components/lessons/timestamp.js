    <p>
      The cryptosat reports the current timestamp in periodic intervals.
      The timestamp, reported as milliseconds since epoch, is signed by the
      satelliteâ€™s public signing key. The timestamp and its signature can be
      obtained using the following API call:
    </p>
    <CodeSnippet code={`result = await cryptosat.getTimestamp();`} />
    <p>
      You can verify the signature of the timestamp with
      the <a href="https://nacl.cr.yp.to/box.html">NaCl</a> library as shown
      in the following snippet:
    </p>
    <CodeSnippet code={`key = await cryptosat.getPublicSigningKey();
timestamp = binary.int2ab(result.timestamp);
nacl.sign.detached.verify(timestamp, result.signature, key);`} />
  </div>
);

export default content;
